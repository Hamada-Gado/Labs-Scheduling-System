# Labs-Scheduling-System
**Project Description.** In this project you are going to implement a scheduling system in
Prolog to assign the weekly labs of a course to the available TAs. The following should
be noted:
- Each lab should be assigned exactly one TA.
- Each TA has a teaching load (the number of labs they are required to teach per week).
- Each TA should not be assigned more labs than their teaching load (but can get less load).
- The number of slots assigned to each TA per day must not exceed a particular specified number.
